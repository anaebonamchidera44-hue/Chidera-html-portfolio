<hr />
<h3>Purple Heart</h3>
<p>This is one of my best american movie. I mostly love the songs that Sofia Carson who is known as 'cassie' in the movie sang.</p>
<h3>Gen v</h3>
<p>This is one of the best series i've watched so far.Filled with mysteries and people that have powers because of a substance given to them by their family members called compound v.</p>
<h3>The dictator</h3>
<p>This is highly recommended if you love movies that makes you laugh Okakpu you know what i mean ^-^. Well its just about a dictator that is dumb but very funny and there is also a very busty woman, she is one of his soldiers who uses her hmm to break things even BRICKS.</p>
